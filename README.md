# My Better Discord
My BetterDiscord setup if anyone wanted to replicate it.

1. Download the repo as zip
2. Install BetterDiscord: https://betterdiscord.app/
3. Place everything inside (not the actual folder) the plugins folder in %appdata%/betterdiscord/plugins
4. Place the BasicBackground css file into %appdata%/betterdiscord/themes
5. In your settings tab, you will see a Custom CSS option; open that
6. Paste all commands present in CSS commands.txt
7. Done!
